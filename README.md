# Memory Game Project

This is an implementation of the classical card matching game.

The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched

Your score is the number of stars you earn at the end of the game. You start with three stars and lose them one by one as you make more moves

You can restart the game anytime by clicking on the restart button at the top of the page.
